            technological devices when I was little and I've since gotten

            technology, <i>there's always more to learn.</i>

            <i>Padding </i> is the space between the
            <b>content of a webpage and its border</b>. <i>Border</i> is the

            <b>padding and the margin</b> . <br />
            <i>Margin</i> is the outer space after the border which
            <b>encompasses the content, border and padding.</b>
